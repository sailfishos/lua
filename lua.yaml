Description: |
    Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for
    extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
    general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software.
    Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
    constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua
    is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic
    memory management with garbage collection, making it ideal for
    configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
